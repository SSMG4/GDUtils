# GDUtils
A repository full of Geometry Dash utilities such as macros, mods, Geode mods, and more!

# Notes
- Note 1: TASBot is a mod made only for Geometry Dash 2.1, meaning all macros made with it are specific to 2.1 and the mod wont work on 2.2.
- Note 2: TASBot macros and macros from any other macro loader will often not work with each either, meaning that for example, you most of the times wont be able to use a TASBot macro with xdBot.
